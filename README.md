# JavaScript 30 🔥

Welcome to my journey through the **JavaScript 30 Challenge** — a 30-day challenge created by [Wes Bos](https://javascript30.com) to improve core JavaScript skills by building 30 fun, interactive projects — without libraries or frameworks.

## 🚀 Why I'm Doing This

I started this challenge to:
- Build a solid foundation in vanilla JavaScript skills
- Gain hands-on experience with DOM manipulation, events, and more

---

> 🔧 More projects will be added here as I complete each day.
